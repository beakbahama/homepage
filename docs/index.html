This website will be a place for my thoughts, projects, and relevant life experiences.

I plan on writing about culture, aggression, genitals, existence, political races, human races, and other animal races, particularly the dog, cat, and squirrel races.

You can contact me at dick@whomanatee.org. Dick is a nickname and <a href="http://whomanatee.org" target="_blank">whomanatee</a> is a project I've been working on that aims to create an amazing world for all. Check out the site when you have time and let me know if you have any questions. I'll post answers to any on this site.

For now, I wanted to very briefly discuss chins. Did you know that chins are the only unique feature among all life including all upright walking primates? Maybe like me you had thought that big brains are what make us special, but they're not. The Neanderthal, whom is often depicted as intellectually inferior to us, had a slightly bigger brain than us. But chins, only we have them. Do you remember ever using your chin? I use mine every day and I can tell because I can feel it giving a sensation, a sort of numb and relaxing tingle. I am working on showing you and everyone how to start using theirs, too. Based on my estimates, getting the ability to use your chin again will take on average 2-5 years. It's taken me longer than 2 years but I'm hoping some will be able to get their chin back faster than I've been able to do so. I'm not completely there yet, but I'm nearing having complete chin access, likely by 2025. Once all humans worldwide get their chins back, we'll be able to start working as one humanity to create an amazing world for all. Chins promote cooperation. Chins promote not using aggression when uncertain of what to do. It kept us from fighting each other for over 200,000 years and once we get them back we can stop fighting again until the sun destroys us. The sun provideth and the sun also destroyeth. Without the sun there would be no animal life. Animal life needs a warm planet but not too warm to exist, and our position in the solar system gave our planet the right ingredients for animal life to form some 600 million years ago. And in less than the past 1 million years, the human chin formed, and we're here now. My estimate is that humanity lost their chins about 6000 years ago, when humans started living in big cities with complex social structures. Our ability to domesticate crops and animals lead to us being able to build cities. Once we had cities we started taking advantage of each other. We would have had to have lost our chins for that to have happened, so it was all brought on by people getting afraid and angry. When you get angry you lose your chin. When you get afraid you lose your chin. The chin promotes thinking, and if you're scared or angry, the chin goes away so that the base animal fight-flight brain can take over. The chin will get you to sit and think until you come up with a solution that doesn't need fight or flight. You'll be able to find a solution to any human issue that leads to group cohesion, the bond that we call love, AKA family love.

On another note, how does a yearly world pizza party sound? Couldn't everyone use a pizza party to feel a little better? Are you interested in having one on April 4th of this year? I started a discussion thread on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/whomanatee/discussions/2" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I am also working on a world community log which we can use in the future to set up events, but it's not yet been developed. You can check it out <a href="http://cloggy.org" target="_blank">here</a>. One of the posts is about the pizza party.
